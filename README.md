# FinanceConsulter

## Use Cases (simplified)
- The user wants to insert transactions into the system and categorize them.
- The user wants to scan a receipt and get the information into the system.
- When using the scanner, each product appears as a standalone entry with information about category, origin and price.
- The user wants to have an overview over his finances.
- The overview contains possible improvements generated by AI based on set preferences.

## Project To-Do (from use cases)

1. Foundation & Setup
   - [X] Decide tech stack (backend, frontend, DB) and create base project structure
   - [ ] Initialize repo tooling (lint, format, tests, CI)
   - [ ] Authentication (accounts, sessions/JWT) and basic RBAC

2. Core Domain & Data
   - [ ] Define domain model: Users, Accounts, Categories, Transactions, Receipts, LineItems, Preferences, Suggestions
   - [ ] Create initial database schema and migrations
   - [ ] Seed scripts and fixtures for local dev

3. Transactions & Categorization
   - [ ] CRUD for transactions and categories (API + minimal UI)
   - [ ] Bulk import (CSV) and validation
   - [ ] Auto-categorization rules with manual review and audit trail

4. Receipts: Upload → OCR → Parse
   - [ ] Upload images/PDF; store raw files with metadata
   - [ ] OCR pipeline (e.g., Tesseract) with basic preprocessing
   - [ ] Parse OCR into structured line items (desc, qty, price, total, tax, merchant, date)
   - [ ] Map line items to categories and products

5. Overview & Insights
   - [ ] Dashboard: spend by category/time, cashflow, top merchants, trends
   - [ ] Exports (CSV) and saved reports
   - [ ] Preferences UI (budgets, goals, sensitivities)
   - [ ] AI suggestions MVP (deterministic rules first; external AI optional later)

6. Quality & Delivery
   - [ ] Test coverage (unit/integration/e2e) and CI pipeline
   - [ ] Docker/devcontainer for reproducible dev
   - [ ] Deployment docs (local, cloud), backups, and monitoring basics

## Next Steps (concrete)
- Decide stack and repo layout:
  - Backend: FastAPI (Python)
  - Frontend: React (Vite/Next.js)
  - DB: SQLite 
- Create skeleton projects and wire CI (lint, test)
- Draft the ERD and first migration for core entities
- Implement minimal transactions + categories CRUD to enable basic usage
- Add receipt upload endpoint and stub OCR service (return mock items)

## Notes
- Keep AI features privacy-first and optional; no external calls required for MVP.
- Prioritize offline/local processing for OCR to avoid external dependencies.
